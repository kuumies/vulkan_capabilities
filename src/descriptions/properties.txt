@@
Device Name
deviceName is a null-terminated UTF-8 string containing the name of the device.

@@
Device Type
deviceType is a VkPhysicalDeviceType specifying the type of device.
<p><p>
VK_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TYPE_OTHER - the device does not match any other available types.
<p><p>
VK_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TYPE_INTEGRATED_GPU - the device is typically one embedded in or tightly coupled with the host.
<p><p>
VK_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TYPE_DISCRETE_GPU - the device is typically a separate processor connected to the host via an interlink.
<p><p>
VK_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TYPE_VIRTUAL_GPU - the device is typically a virtual node in a virtualization environment.
<p><p>
VK_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TYPE_CPU - the device is typically running on the same processors as the host.

@@
API Version
apiVersion is the version of Vulkan supported by the device, encoded as described in the API Version Numbers and Semantics section.

@@
Driver Version
driverVersion is the vendor-specified version of the driver.

@@
Vendor ID
vendorID is a unique identifier for the vendor (see below) of the physical device.

@@
Device ID
deviceID is a unique identifier for the physical device among devices available from the vendor.

@@
Pipeline Cache UUID
pipelineCacheUUID is an array of size VK_UUID_SIZE, containing 8-bit values that represent a universally unique identifier for the device.

@@
Device UUID
deviceUUID is an array of size VK_UUID_SIZE, containing 8-bit values that represent a universally unique identifier for the device.

@@
Driver UUID
driverUUID is an array of size VK_UUID_SIZE, containing 8-bit values that represent a universally unique identifier for the driver build in use by the device.

@@
Device LUID
deviceLUID is an array of size VK_LUID_SIZE_KHR, containing 8-bit values that represent a locally unique identifier for the device.

@@
Device Node Mask
deviceNodeMask is a bitfield identifying the node within a linked device adapter corresponding to the device.

@@
Device LUID Valid
deviceLUIDValid is a boolean value that will be VK_TRUE if deviceLUID contains a valid LUID and deviceNodeMask contains a valid node mask, and VK_FALSE if they do not.
